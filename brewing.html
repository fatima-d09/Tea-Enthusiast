                    <h2>Steeping</h2>
                    <p class="brew">
                        Steeping is the most common method for brewing tea. It involves soaking the tea leaves in hot water for a specific period, which allows the flavors and aromas to infuse into the water. The key to mastering this technique lies in controlling the water temperature and timing: too hot, and the tea may become bitter; too long, and it might lose its delicate nuances. Generally, green teas require cooler water and shorter steep times, while black teas can handle near-boiling temperatures and benefit from longer steeping.                    </p>

                    <h2>Boiling</h2>
                    <p class="brew">
                        Boiling is a traditional method used primarily for stronger teas like black or pu-erh teas. This robust technique involves bringing water to a full boil with the tea leaves already in it and allowing them to simmer together. The result is a full-bodied brew, often with a deeper color and a more pronounced taste, favored in many cultures for its intensity and warmth.                    </p>

                    <h2>Cold Brewing</h2>
                    <p class="brew">
                        Cold brewing is a method where tea leaves are steeped in cold water for several hours or even overnight in the refrigerator. The slow infusion process at low temperatures draws out a smoother, more subtle flavor profile, often with less bitterness and astringency than tea brewed with hot water. It's an excellent choice for making refreshing iced tea or for those who prefer a milder taste.                    </p>

                    <h2>Sun Tea</h2>
                    <p class="brew">
                        Sun tea is made by leaving a container of water and tea leaves to steep in direct sunlight. The gentle warmth of the sun slowly heats the water, creating a brewing condition that is not possible indoors. The resulting tea is usually quite mellow and can be a delightful way to enjoy herbal or fruit teas. However, it's important to monitor the brewing process closely, as too much time in the sun can lead to spoilage.                    </p>

                    <h2>Matcha Preparation</h2>
                    <p class="brew">
                        Matcha tea requires a unique process where powdered green tea is whisked with hot water until it becomes frothy. Unlike other teas, matcha involves consuming the entire leaf in powdered form, which can amplify its health benefits. The key to perfect matcha lies in sifting the powder to avoid lumps and whisking briskly in an 'M' or 'W' motion to create the characteristic froth. A traditional bamboo whisk, known as a chasen, is typically used for this process, contributing to the meditative aspect of matcha preparation.                    </p>
